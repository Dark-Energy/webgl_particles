Application 

function constructor take one optoional parameter (config)
config may be 
    string containing url
    'object' containing data like json pared object, look 'config.json' in 'json' folder
    nothing, then get default configuration

    configuration data getting from url or object are merjed with default configuration. all fields in default rewritten by fields from given configuration.
    
    
function constructor create renderer, create webgl canvas, binding it with dom element, setting some parameters, including
screen size, 
background filling color

then constructor create main_scene Scene object and main_camera Camera object and set it properties:
fov,
aspect ratio,
near clipping plane
far clipping plane
position

that is i am leazy and i don't wont create main scene and camera by hand every time

LIFHOOK

before carry out all this things, Application call method "before_created", if it given

after carry out all this things, Application call method "created", if it given

=======

Probably, need remove this code from constructor and place it in method "start"?

method "start" will take arguments: 
"configuration", 
"create default scene and camera"
and else other


========

loop
main method starts rendering loop
loop consists of two stages

1) update
taken delta which contains delta time interval from last update
default method call update_all
update_all - update all animated objects, appended in Application.animatited_objects


2) render

default method 
clear background with default clear color
set Auto Clear Color to true
and render main_scene with main_camera
