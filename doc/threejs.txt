*can do intersection check, if object material property 'visible' if false. 

i am need check invisible objects

*color can get string of hexadecimal "0xff00ff" and convert it to color values
it accept only "css style format", when digits leads with #, for example #ff00ff
json can't save number in hexadeciaml of any formats

also i add "update" method to Object3D, which resurively update child objects. Each object have "animations" array. Each element must be derived from Base_Animation class. This allows fast and simple create animated scene node.

This is done in "threejs_patches.js" module.
