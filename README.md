# Particles Project

It is my particle project, constructed with CPU & GPU approach. Not much fast, but flexibility. Also there is simple particle editor, though it can doing very small indeed. Probably i am going to develope it further. 


### Tools and design

I used three.js and vue. User interface code completely separated from renderer, and it may be replaced with code, bulding on base any other framework.
